Day 7: I had to completely refactor between part 1 and 2... I can certainly see why people who did it correctly had no issues going between the parts. Unfortunately I do not and do not have my original for part 1 anymore.

Day 8: Started about 20 minutes late for this one. The solution I came up with for the first part needed to be pretty heavily modified. I was in a state where example worked but input didn't. Ended up having a problem with the way I added nodes that had > 2 frequencies in it.

Day 9: I had a hard time with this one even part 1, I am not sure why. My code is messy all around... even more then normal. Part 2 wasn't working, I got the sample to work but then my input was failing. Tweaked a bunch of things, but ultimately still felt like I was doing the same logic. But the main change I made from not working -> working was switching to not using a copy array and back tracking through the ID's instead of through the original array and ignoring the '.'.

Day 10: Solved Part 1 pretty quickly (For me at least), and Part 2 I had a simple recursion bug that took some time to sort through so lost a bit of time despite some of my code from part 1 being reusable.
